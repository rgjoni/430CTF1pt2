# csci430 - CTF1 bank app (flask version)

## how to install

you will need:

- python3
- pip3




you may or may not have to do the following:

- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install python3.6`
- `sudo apt install python3-pip`
- `pip3 install flask`
- `pip3 install passlib`

note that on deterlab, you need to use pip3 slightly differently. see piazza
for details. i will not describe it here, for security reasons

also, you can use a higher version of python. the only reason i wrote 3.6 in the
list above is because that's what's on our deterlab node




## how to run

to run, do
`python3 main.py`

## notes

note that the database is reset every time you restart the server. this is okay,
since this is just a CTF exercise for class, and we dont really need to store
all of that info
